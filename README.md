# vl_core

vl_core is core of Viva Library and contains some helpful functions (including functionality of VL plugins).

> [Viva Library](https://vits.pro/dev/) is helpful library for more fast creation of personal and corporate websites. This library
> can help to typical site task: content management (using django-cms plugin mechanism), seo, some utils and so on.

> **NOTE:** Documentation is writing and now here you can read description of some functionality only.
